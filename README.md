# Online Customer Segmentation

This project focuses on segmenting customers using K-Means clustering based on their purchasing behavior. The main objective is to help businesses target specific customer groups for better marketing strategies.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset used is the **Online Retail Dataset**, which contains transactions made by customers from a UK-based online store over a year. It includes fields like InvoiceNo, StockCode, Description, Quantity, InvoiceDate, UnitPrice, CustomerID, and Country.

## 💡 Objective
The goal is to identify distinct customer segments based on transactional behavior, which can help businesses in customer retention, personalized marketing, and improving overall customer satisfaction.

## 🔍 Key Steps
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handled missing values, removed duplicates, and filtered data.
- **Feature Engineering:** Created RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) metrics.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualized distributions and patterns using plots.
- **K-Means Clustering:** Applied the Elbow Method to find the optimal number of clusters.
- **Cluster Visualization:** Used scatter plots and heatmaps to interpret clusters.
